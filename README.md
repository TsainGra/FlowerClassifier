# FlowerClassifier
A flower classifier that uses deep neural networks to classify 5 different types of flower - daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers and tulips. The classifier uses a convolutional deep neural network which is based on Google's Inception model. Only the bottlenecks were modified in the process. In order to run this program your machine must have <b>docker</b> installed.
The library used is the popular machine learning library <b>TensorFlow</b>. <b>A series of docker commands are also included which need to be run prior to the program.</b>
